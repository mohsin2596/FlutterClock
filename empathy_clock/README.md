# Empathy Clock

A digital clock made in using Flutter and Flare animations. This project is a submission for my entry into the FlutterClock competition. 

## Why the name?

I wanted to use this oppurtunity to test out my creative side and share with everyone a message through my app. In empathy clock you would find a homeless character animated in the bottom right corner of the screen, the character wakes up in the morning and goes away for his chores/work and would return back to you at sunset. 

Character wouldn't be able to sleep if its raining or there is a fierce thunderstorm going on.

## Features

- Animated character that responds to time and weather
- Different animations for all seasons part of the competition (sunny, windy, cloudy, thunderstorm, rainy, snowy)
- Beautiful sunset animation also included
- The stars, moon, sun and clouds would animate according to weather and time

All animations were created in Flare with my original artwork and were manipulated with Flutter.
